# Alex Hoskins Portfolio

This directory is a web application built to showcase Alex Hoskins' work. You will find an about me, contact, and projects section. The application was created with React. It was deployed using Vercel and can be viewed by clicking the link below.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

The application was created with React, deployed on Vercel, and given a custom domain name. Their are hyperlinks that will take you to Alex's LinkedIn, Github, and Gmail.

## Optimizations: 

I utilized react in order to make large, reusable components for the projects sections. We are not using a lot of data, as the projects list isn't exhaustive, but making reusable components is absolutely worth it even for short lists.

## Lessons Learned:  

Create a simple design that meets MVP and iterate. It's best to have something that works vs a big idea that can't be deployed. Meet MVP and then make it better!

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

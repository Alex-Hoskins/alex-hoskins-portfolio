# Alex Hoskins Portfolio

This directory is a web application built to showcase Alex Hoskins' work. You will find an about me, contact, and projects section. The application was created with React. It was deployed using Vercel and can be viewed by clicking the link below.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

The application was created with React.

## Optimizations: 

I utilized react in order to make large, reusable components.

## Lessons Learned:  

**1)** There is a lot of boilerplate code when using redux. Every time you wanted to create a new action you had to touch three files in order to get the action to work. This seems repetitive and not very DRY. Next time I will explore context API a bit more but Redux got the job done in this project.

**2)** Due to the large amounts of components, it was tricky making sure all of the routing was correct. I wanted to make sure when you clicked on a WorkSpace, or any specific component, that the route corresponed correctly. This allows the forward and back arrows to work correctly when you are navigating the history on the browser. 

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
